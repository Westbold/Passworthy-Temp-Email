# API Specification

The Worker exposes JSON REST endpoints through Hono and publishes generated OpenAPI
documentation at:

- `GET /openapi.json`
- `GET /swagger`
- `GET /`

All successful API responses use:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {}
}
```

Error responses use:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "name": "ErrorName",
    "message": "Error message"
  }
}
```

## Authorization

Claim, email, and inbox endpoints require:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <claim-key>
```

The Worker stores a SHA-256 hash of the bearer key. The original key is never stored.

Claims are permanent and do not expire. A claim can be released only with the same bearer key
that created it.

Public endpoints:

- `GET /domains`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /openapi.json`
- `GET /swagger`
- `GET /`

## Health

### Health Check

## Inbound Email Behavior

Cloudflare Email Routing invokes the Worker for inbound email. The Worker checks the recipient
claim before parsing the raw message:

- Claimed recipient: parse email, store it in D1, then optionally forward it to the webhook.
- Unclaimed recipient: discard the message. It is not parsed, stored, or forwarded.

Incoming attachments are ignored.

## Webhook Delivery

Webhook forwarding is enabled only when both `WEBHOOK_URL` and `WEBHOOK_SECRET` are configured.
The Worker sends one request per stored email:

```http
POST <WEBHOOK_URL>
Content-Type: application/json
X-Webhook-Signature: HMAC-SHA512=<base64_hmac_sha512_of_body>
```

The signature is an HMAC-SHA512 over the exact UTF-8 JSON request body using `WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

Payload:

```json
{
  "id": "usm2sw0qfv9a5ku9z4xmh8og",
  "from_address": "sender@example.com",
  "to_address": "recipient@barid.site",
  "subject": "Welcome to our service",
  "received_at": 1753317948,
  "html_content": "<p>Hello world</p>",
  "text_content": "Hello world"
}
```

Webhook failures are logged but do not reject or delete stored email. Webhooks are centralized
and are not authenticated with per-address claim keys.
